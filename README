Small CMS, based on Kohana PHP framework.

Inside WYSIWYG html-editor FCKeditor for content creation is used.

Content is organized by tag-based taxonomy.

Change path in these files for CMS to work:
- application/media/javascript/application.js replace path to ajax request animation "/k/media/icons/busy.gif" to path, 
  relative to your server name in all places in this file;
- application/media/javascript/fckeditor/fckconfig.js replace all addresses like "/k/" to valid addresses, relative to
  your server name;
- application/controllers/media.php change path "/var/www/html/k/application/" to directory, where 'media' directory 
  is placed;
- application/views/admin/tags/javascripts.php replace path to ajax request animation "/k/media/icons/busy.gif" and 
  path to action for ajax drag-n-drop records sorting "/k/admin/taggings/edit/....."

In all above files path "/k/..." means "http://your-server/k/...." url. In most typical installations replace all such
urls with "http://you-server/....".
